# Virtual Japanese manuscript paper

Virtual Japanese manuscript paper created purely with HTML and CSS, made for fun.

## Demo

## Description
Manuscript paper is used generally for Japanese handwriting or nicely laid out
longform articles, and I quite like the vertical writing style, so I thought I would
check out how I could make a grid in the least number of HTML tags to fake it on a webpage.

Probably not the most exciting or unique thing in the world, but you can edit the text on the page
and it also can be printed for handwriting practice!

## Notes
Requires modern browser support for CSS3 writing mode, multiple backgrounds and linear gradients.

I would have used flexbox for the layout but the interactions with top-bottom, right-left
text flow elements completely broke scrolling when the virtual paper overflowed. Oh well.
